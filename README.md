This repository hosts the exercises for Robotics II course of ECE NTUA.

Collaborators: Konstantinos Tsiggelis Konstantinos Spathis 

### Lab 1 

We conduct kinematic control of a robotic manipulator with redundant degrees of freedom: Trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance. We use ROS and Gazebo for the visualization.

### Lab 2

The goal of this lab is to implement a control algorithm so that a self-pilot car can perform a cyclic motion inside the space defined by the obstacles without hitting them.
